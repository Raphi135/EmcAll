# EmcAll
A text file for minecraft's Projecte mod assigning emc values to virtually everything.

The goal is to give emc values to as many base items in as many mods as possible. The "custom_emc" file holds all of the custom values I have been able to set so far in no particular order. A large majority have been set on the fly while playing modpacks, and so values may not equal what people expect them to be. However I still try to give a reasonable value to everything based on: rarity, attributes, usefulness, similarities between other items, etc.
